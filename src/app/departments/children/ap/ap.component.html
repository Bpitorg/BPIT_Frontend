					As we know, Physics provides the solution for the mechanism of the basic phenomena occurring in the
					field of other sciences. The main aim of the department is to maintain an active, congenial
					atmosphere for teaching and learning in which faculty members set a high priority in teaching and
					subscribe to building a caring learning environment for students. The Department has five well
					qualified and trained teachers who are ready to train and motivate students to inculcate the
					scientific learning approach among them. Moreover, the department has one well equipped Applied
					Physics Lab in which the students learn various basic principles of Physics through practice and
					self realization.
